<p>Scenarios were created to streamline the planning processes and give stakeholders one platform to create, approve, execute, and most importantly, iterate on headcount plans as business conditions change.</p>

<p>Before building in ChartHop, take the following into consideration:</p>
<h3><strong>1. What question(s) am I trying to answer?</strong></h3>
<p>We recommend starting with one key question and objective. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If we secure our series B for $10mm, how should we ramp up our growth plan?</li>
<li>If we lose our top 2 managers, what will our sales leadership structure look like next year?</li>
<li>If sales decrease by 15%, where can I make cuts to our future hiring plan?</li>
<li>If we need to launch a new product in 2 months, how does the org need to evolve?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>2. Do I have access to the data I need?</strong></h3>
<p>Depending on your questions, what data do you need to combine and visualize to make the best decisions? For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If you're asking "How should we ramp up our growth plan?", consider looking at Monthly cost by operating group (R&amp;D vs. S&amp;M)</li>
<li>If you're asking "What will our sales leadership structure look like next year?", consider looking at Nine-box ratings viewed by attrition-risk</li>
<li>If you're asking "Where can I make cuts to our future hiring plan?", consider looking at Average projected cost for all open roles by department</li>
<li>If you're asking "How does the org need to evolve in the next year?", consider looking at the Ratio of  Engineering headcount to Product headcount </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>3. Who do I need to collaborate with?</strong></h3>
<p>Who needs to be involved at every stage of the process -- from data capture to decision making?</p>
<p>Keep the following in mind:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Managers on the front-line have the most up-to-date pulse on the performance, potential, and risks on their team. Consider including them as a phase 1.</li>
<li>Finance &amp; HR/People teams need to be in lock-step to align on budgets and data-driven insights. Clearly define the stages in your planning or scenario building process and who owns/contributes/has visibility into which pieces of the pie.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Once you go through these steps, you're ready to start modeling our your Scenarios in ChartHop!</p>
<p>With Scenarios, you can build sandbox views for alternate hiring plans, projected M&amp;A outcomes, department-specific views, org-wide compensation planning, and more. After youâ€™ve designed plans, itâ€™s easy to deploy them into action within ChartHop or export them into a desired .csv structure and use in any way.</p>
