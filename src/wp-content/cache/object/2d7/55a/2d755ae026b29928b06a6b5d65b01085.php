Today, Showbie ranks as a top-selling education app for iOS, and more than 2 million teachers and students in 136 countries use Showbie in their classrooms.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet the market is quickly evolving, thanks in large part to the distance-learning demands created during the COVID-19 pandemic. ‚ÄúWe want to be there to meet the need,‚Äù says Colin Bramm, CEO and co-founder of </span><a href="https://www.showbie.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Showbie</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. ‚ÄúWe want to make sure people are aware of the solutions we offer to make the most of this current situation.‚Äù</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That means taking these unique market demands in stride with their post-Series A growth plans and being strategic about it. Bramm continues: ‚ÄúFor us, it‚Äôs</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a question of how do we staff up our team? What kind of company response are we going to need to help our customers and to grow the value of the business over the next several years?‚Äù</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to achieve intentional and sustainable growth, Bramm knew he needed to tackle a challenge common to growing organizations: </span>Presenting a clear growth path around which Showbie‚Äôs leadership team and entire company could align.
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Searching for a Path to Growth Buried Inside Spreadsheets</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Designing the future of Showbie has been top of mind for Bramm since their Series A fundraising in August 2020, but planning this new and exciting stage hasn‚Äôt been easy.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúI was looking at our hiring plans for the next year, which were a complete spreadsheet conundrum,‚Äù Bramm admits. ‚ÄúIt was just a total disaster of spreadsheets and timelines and Gantt charts.‚Äù</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once Bramm compiled the budget, headcount, and month-over-month growth projections, he presented those figures to Showbie‚Äôs board and leadership team.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As they talked through the figures, various scenarios would emerge:</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If things are going really well for the company and we have more revenue, then I‚Äôd like to do this</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">if things aren‚Äôt growing as much, then I‚Äôd like to do this but a little bit less of that. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">But these scenarios were difficult to visualize, which made alignment near impossible.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúAll that work didn‚Äôt even matter because the format wasn‚Äôt something that I could easily communicate to other people,‚Äù Bramm confessed. He had graphs and charts to augment the numbers, but none of it clearly laid out what growing Showbie would </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">actually</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> look like.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bramm needed his board and leadership team on the same page about Showbie‚Äôs path to growth and realized their current tools could no longer get them there. So Bramm went searching for a solution that could make that crucial alignment possible.</span>";}s:15:"_rcs_ps_content";a:1:{i:0;s:19:"field_62567a3b2d364";}s:12:"rcs_ps_title";a:1:{i:0;s:24:"ChartHop helped Showbie:";}s:13:"_rcs_ps_title";a:1:{i:0;s:19:"field_625680d62d365";}s:15:"rcs_ps_template";a:1:{i:0;s:8:"version1";}s:16:"_rcs_ps_template";a:1:{i:0;s:19:"field_625681062d367";}s:19:"rcs_ps_items_0_icon";a:1:{i:0;s:4:"3961";}s:20:"_rcs_ps_items_0_icon";a:1:{i:0;s:19:"field_62568312b0261";}s:22:"rcs_ps_items_0_caption";a:1:{i:0;s:105:"Easily visualize potential growth scenarios by turning a tangle of spreadsheets into actionable insights.";}s:23:"_rcs_ps_items_0_caption";a:1:{i:0;s:19:"field_62568358b0263";}s:19:"rcs_ps_items_1_icon";a:1:{i:0;s:4:"3962";}s:20:"_rcs_ps_items_1_icon";a:1:{i:0;s:19:"field_62568312b0261";}s:22:"rcs_ps_items_1_caption";a:1:{i:0;s:112:"Save the leadership team over $10,000 in lost productivity thanks to more effective planning and board meetings.";}s:23:"_rcs_ps_items_1_caption";a:1:{i:0;s:19:"field_62568358b0263";}s:19:"rcs_ps_items_2_icon";a:1:{i:0;s:4:"3963";}s:20:"_rcs_ps_items_2_icon";a:1:{i:0;s:19:"field_62568312b0261";}s:22:"rcs_ps_items_2_caption";a:1:{i:0;s:83:"Communicate company and employee growth thoughtfully to preserve a high eNPS of 85.";}s:23:"_rcs_ps_items_2_caption";a:1:{i:0;s:19:"field_62568358b0263";}s:12:"rcs_ps_items";a:1:{i:0;s:1:"3";}s:13:"_rcs_ps_items";a:1:{i:0;s:19:"field_625680ec2d366";}s:21:"ts_single_testimonial";a:1:{i:0;s:21:"a:1:{i:0;s:4:"3968";}";}s:22:"_ts_single_testimonial";a:1:{i:0;s:19:"field_6268daf69832e";}s:15:"rcs_ps2_content";a:1:{i:0;s:8920:"<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introducing Powerful Visuals and Real-Time Collaboration to Achieve Alignment</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To grow in an ever-changing industry, Showbie needed an equally dynamic solution.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, Bramm wanted the flexibility to deliver powerful visuals his teams could easily understand. That‚Äôs when an industry acquaintance introduced him to</span><a href="https://www.charthop.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ChartHop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Right away, Bramm knew ChartHop would help his board and leadership team visualize potential growth outcomes for Showbie. All he had to do was upload the details from spreadsheets, and ChartHop would transform that data into immediate, actionable insights ‚Äì saving Showbie time and money.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ChartHop‚Äôs scenario mapping feature would allow Bramm to create and explore various futures for Showbie, like the creation of cross-functional teams or what the company would look like if it made various strategic hiring decisions. But it was the ease of creating these scenarios using drag-and-drop functionality and on-page filtering that showed Bramm how easy real-time collaboration would be once he had leadership in the same room. For Showbie, this was the goal: present a powerful vision for the future that leadership (and the company as a whole) could rally around.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like I‚Äôve got this superpower added to my arsenal that is letting me really lead the company and talk about how this will positively impact us </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allow us to meet our goals this year with everybody involved,‚Äù Bramm explains.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Importantly, ChartHop‚Äôs ability to easily integrate with and sync data daily from Showbie‚Äôs human resources system, BambooHR, gave Bramm confidence that the leadership team could make informed decisions about the future since they would be working from a single source of truth.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúWhen those data pieces are consolidated to one system, it really [becomes] that living, breathing system of record for people and growth,‚Äù Bramm shares.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partnering with ChartHop to Strike a Balance Between Thoughtful and Strategic Growth</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bramm hit the ground running with ChartHop and saw the benefits almost immediately, quickly developing a primary growth plan to show his board.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Having visuals and the flexibility of scenario planning leveled up Showbie‚Äôs board meetings. Together, the board walked through half a dozen ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù scenarios, seeing the actual implications of growing one department over three months versus six months or the makeup of the workforce with the implementation of equitable hiring practices.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For Showbie, </span><b>ChartHop was a planning gamechanger.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ‚ÄúThis board meeting versus what we used to have as a board meeting was 10 times more effective and mature and professional than what I‚Äôve seen before,‚Äù Bramm admits. ‚ÄúBetween the work it saved me, and the work it saved our leadership team, we probably saved over $10,000 in lost productivity ‚Äì in just one planning process. The most powerful part was being able to put it in front of the leadership team so there's clarity on the plan, and being able to make changes to the scenario in real time based on feedback we discussed in the meeting.‚Äù¬†</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communicating a Clear Vision for Growth</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Energized by the enthusiastic reception his growth plan received from the board and leadership team, Bramm decided to reveal the growth plan to Showbie‚Äôs employees in the first Town Hall meeting of their fiscal year.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúEverybody was excited to actually see, ‚ÄòOkay, it‚Äôs not actually this pie-in-the-sky vision to get from here to there, and theoretically this is how it‚Äôs going to happen. Here‚Äôs the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">actual</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> org implication of where I sit in the company,‚Äô‚Äù Bramm explains. ‚ÄúWe were able to be very transparent about that.‚Äù</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">He notes that rapid growth like Showbie‚Äôs makes it easy for team members to quickly become overtasked and feel overwhelmed. Using ChartHop, he could show teams key numbers, like the ratio of managers to individual contributors, that demonstrate how leadership is thinking about these challenges.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very important for us to communicate that while you‚Äôre kind of alone right now in your function, this is how we see the company being able to support this area of the business over the next three, six, nine, and 12 months.‚Äù</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bramm even found himself having similar conversations with external candidates being considered for key roles. Using ChartHop‚Äôs scenarios, Bramm could share plans for the marketing or design team, showing those lead candidates what he believes those teams will look like over the next few quarters.</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having Honest and Transparent Conversations</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Presenting the growth plan to the entire organization naturally led to conversations about employees‚Äô professional growth. ‚ÄúPeople got the potential career tracks for themselves,‚Äù Bramm says. ‚Äú[We could] have the warm-up conversations and say that certain members might go into lead roles this year.‚Äù</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But with that big-picture view of Showbie‚Äôs current state and where they wanted to go, it became increasingly obvious where Bramm needed to bring on external candidates versus promoting from within ‚Äì and that meant having difficult, but honest conversations.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúWhile everybody on this current Showbie team including myself has strengths, there‚Äôs also areas where we‚Äôre not as strong,‚Äù Bramm explains. ‚ÄúWe do need people who have done this or that at another company, who can pull Showbie up to that next level.‚Äù</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bramm admits it was scary to have those challenging conversations, but having month-over-month growth projections for each team made it easier to explain the choices the leadership team made to ensure Showbie would be successful in their post-Series A phase.</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discovering Unexpected, but Exciting Opportunities</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As Bramm and the whole Showbie team began working more within the ChartHop platform, they quickly ‚Äì and rather unexpectedly ‚Äì discovered additional growth opportunities.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúIt became very obvious to us that we needed to have a subsidiary in the UK, and that was not obvious in the spreadsheets at all,‚Äù Bramm says.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ChartHop‚Äôs map view made this possible. As COVID-19 precautions normalized remote work and Zoom calls around the world, it became easier for Bramm to visualize how Showbie could conduct business remotely and expand into new markets. Yet tackling growing markets in the UK and Western Europe brought a second discovery: the need for customer-facing teams across time zones.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to support teachers around the world, Showbie reached out to those who knew their product best ‚Äì fellow teachers. In bringing on what Bramm calls ‚ÄúMVP teachers,‚Äù Showbie was able to offer round-the-clock support coverage while also supporting teachers on leave due to COVID-19.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growing with Your People in Mind</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">At Showbie, growth is less about the financials and more about the people. Showbie boasts an employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) of 85, a rating that measures employees‚Äô enthusiasm for where they work. It‚Äôs a score Bramm is proud of and wants to preserve. Thoughtful yet strategic growth will get them there.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúI think everyone who works here deserves to be part of an organization where their personal growth is fostered,‚Äù Bramm says. ‚ÄúAnd ChartHop gives us a complete picture of where we‚Äôre going and how we‚Äôre going to grow our people.‚Äù</span>";}s:16:"_rcs_ps2_content";a:1:{i:0;s:19:"field_625689f070270";}s:13:"rcs_ps2_title";a:1:{i:0;s:0:"";}s:14:"_rcs_ps2_title";a:1:{i:0;s:19:"field_625689f670271";}s:16:"rcs_ps2_template";a:1:{i:0;s:8:"version1";}s:17:"_rcs_ps2_template";a:1:{i:0;s:19:"field_625689fc70272";}s:13:"rcs_ps2_items";a:1:{i:0;s:0:"";}s:14:"_rcs_ps2_items";a:1:{i:0;s:19:"field_62568a0270273";}s:14:"rcs_ps2_button";a:1:{i:0;s:0:"";}s:15:"_rcs_ps2_button";a:1:{i:0;s:19:"field_62568a3d70277";}s:17:"rcs_download_file";a:1:{i:0;s:0:"";}s:18:"_rcs_download_file";a:1:{i:0;s:19:"field_625691633cb47";}s:18:"rcs_customer_cards";a:1:{i:0;s:1:"1";}s:19:"_rcs_customer_cards";a:1:{i:0;s:19:"field_62566a1c1bfaa";}s:21:"rbs_related_resources";a:1:{i:0;s:51:"a:3:{i:0;s:4:"2959";i:1;s:4:"3057";i:2;s:4:"3008";}";}s:22:"_rbs_related_resources";a:1:{i:0;s:19:"field_6257d46832010";}s:20:"rs_related_solutions";a:1:{i:0;s:20:"a:1:{i:0;s:3:"448";}";}s:21:"_rs_related_solutions";a:1:{i:0;s:19:"field_6254f66c71bde";}s:16:"rs_related_links";a:1:{i:0;s:0:"";}s:17:"_rs_related_links";a:1:{i:0;s:19:"field_6254f67f71bdf";}s:38:"_yoast_wpseo_primary_resource_category";a:1:{i:0;s:2:"55";}s:33:"_yoast_wpseo_primary_content_type";a:1:{i:0;s:2:"15";}s:29:"rcs_customer_cards_0_logotype";a:1:{i:0;s:4:"3886";}s:30:"_rcs_customer_cards_0_logotype";a:1:{i:0;s:19:"field_62566a341bfab";}s:28:"rcs_customer_cards_0_founded";a:1:{i:0;s:4:"2013";}s:29:"_rcs_customer_cards_0_founded";a:1:{i:0;s:19:"field_62566b301bfac";}s:29:"rcs_customer_cards_0_industry";a:1:{i:0;s:10:"E-Learning";}s:30:"_rcs_customer_cards_0_industry";a:1:{i:0;s:19:"field_62566bfa1bfad";}s:25:"rcs_customer_cards_0_type";a:1:{i:0;s:0:"";}s:26:"_rcs_customer_cards_0_type";a:1:{i:0;s:19:"field_62566c081bfae";}s:40:"rcs_customer_cards_0_number_of_employees";a:1:{i:0;s:4:"100+";}s:41:"_rcs_customer_cards_0_number_of_employees";a:1:{i:0;s:19:"field_62566c131bfaf";}s:33:"rcs_customer_cards_0_distribution";a:1:{i:0;s:0:"";}s:34:"_rcs_customer_cards_0_distribution";a:1:{i:0;s:19:"field_62566c211bfb0";}s:13:"_thumbnail_id";a:1:{i:0;s:4:"3933";}s:26:"_yoast_wpseo_content_score";a:1:{i:0;s:2:"60";}s:21:"rcs_ps_items_0_status";a:1:{i:0;s:0:"";}s:22:"_rcs_ps_items_0_status";a:1:{i:0;s:19:"field_6256832fb0262";}s:21:"rcs_ps_items_1_status";a:1:{i:0;s:0:"";}s:22:"_rcs_ps_items_1_status";a:1:{i:0;s:19:"field_6256832fb0262";}s:21:"rcs_ps_items_2_status";a:1:{i:0;s:0:"";}s:22:"_rcs_ps_items_2_status";a:1:{i:0;s:19:"field_6256832fb0262";}s:18:"eif_form_shortcode";a:1:{i:0;s:404:"<!--[if lte IE 8]>
