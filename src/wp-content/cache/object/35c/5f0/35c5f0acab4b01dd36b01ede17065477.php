Whether you need to propose one individual net-new headcount to your engineering team or you need to design a brand new growth-mode plan for your go-to-market team, you can use scenarios to workshop ideas, test out changes before deploying them, and manage key workflows within your organization.</p>

<br></br>
<p>The beauty of using ChartHop means you no longer need to <strong><em>plan</em> to plan</strong> (making copies of spreadsheets, preparing templates for the management team, etc.) and instead can focus on the strategy. </p>
<p>Planning can now be a <strong>continuous</strong> process that provides new insights and direction as business conditions evolve. </p>
<h3>It is no longer just planning -- it‚Äôs reacting, adapting, hypothesizing -- and enabling a new level of strategizing that was previously unachievable.</h3>
<br></br>
<p>Below are some of the most commonly use cases for Scenario building:</p>
<h3><strong>1. Annual Planning Cycles</strong></h3>
<p><em>How can you coordinate data-driven decision making and promote visibility across management, leadership, and key stakeholders (without 100s or 1,000s of emails, spreadsheets, and excess meetings)?</em></p>
<p>Power your existing review process by adapting your workflows to exist within ChartHop and leverage Scenarios. Use it for Annual / Quarterly Compensation Reviews, Headcount Planning, and Promotion &amp; Performance Reviews. </p>
<p><strong>Example Workflow:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Phase 1: Front-line manager and management input and data entry</li>
<li>Phase 2: Department leadership and exec approval and recommendations</li>
<li>Phase 3: FP&amp;A and People review, analysis, calibration, and approval</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>2. Org Design and Restructuring</strong></h3>
<p><em>How should your teams, cross-functional teams, departments, and divisions be structured to help your business operate as effectively as possible? Who should be in which roles?</em></p>
<p>Use scenarios for annual org planning, restructuring proposals, or organizational outlooks far into the future. Explore iterations on your org or experimental approaches to org structure together as a team.</p>
<p><strong>Example Workflow:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Phase 1: Invite executives to create their own scenarios and deliver them for quarterly and annual meetings. </li>
<li>Phase 2: Visualize different approaches and dive into the potential impact on overall cost, spend by department or location, span of control, and more.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>3. Ad-Hoc Changes</strong></h3>
<p><em>How can you make it easy for company leaders to understand the potential impact of one-off changes to your existing budget, forecasts, or plans and then submit those changes for approval?</em> </p>
<p>Allow managers or leaders to propose changes to the current plan via Scenarios. Merge proposals together, review on a regular basis and easily push approved changes live.</p>
<p><strong>Example Workflow:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Phase 1: Create a scenario for each department or division leader and include shared access for approvers (People Team, Finance, etc.). Give them the ability to propose new changes on a rolling basis. Instead of sending an email to ask for a new sales rep, a Sales Leader can create the role in their scenario with notes for your review.</li>
<li>Phase 2: Merge proposed changes from the above into your People or FP&amp;A ‚Äúreview‚Äù scenario to make decisions on a weekly, biweekly, or monthly basis. Review submissions and decide which ones to approve or reject. Merge approved changes to Primary, and voil√° - new roles can be automatically opened in your ATS!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>4. Alternative Plans</strong></h3>
<p><em>How can you prepare for the unpredictable and plan for a variety of outcomes -- for the entire org, individual teams or departments?</em></p>
<p>Pre-plan possible outcomes at the beginning of the year and each quarter; leverage scenarios when you need to re-imagine potential iterations on the fly.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>5% Budget Cut</li>
<li>M&amp;A</li>
<li>EOY Business Downturn</li>
<li>Global Expansion</li>
<li>Contingency Plan A</li>
<li>Conservative Headcount Forecast</li>
<li>Growth-Mode Headcount Forecast</li>
<li>Series B Hiring Plan</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Example Workflow:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Phase 1: Set targets for the scenario you‚Äôre creating (e.g. reduce hiring plan costs by 50%, support GTM for new product w/ increased R&amp;D investment) and define the outcome criteria. </li>
<li>Phase 2: Build-in ChartHop: Bulk edit, drag and drop teams and roles. Create custom charts or custom fields to view potential impact. For example: create a field for ‚ÄúEssential workers‚Äù and upload the data to your scenario. Quickly visualize where you may be able to make changes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>5.Succession Planning</strong></h3>
<p><em>Is our organization set up for strong management and leadership for the future?</em></p>
<p>Visualize data on current leadership, potential, and performance to quickly assess your bench and propose future models in the org.</p>
<p><strong>Example Workflow:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Phase 1: Execute your performance reviews through ChartHop or import your performance review information from another system</li>
<li>Phase 2: Install ChartHop‚Äôs <a href="https://app.charthop.com/settings/bundles/nine-box-rating" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">nine-box bundle</a> - to view Potential leadership gaps in the org - and view alongside open headcount, budgets, and performance data.</li>
</ul>
